We firmly believe in the potential that lies within Guatemala to expand peopleâ€™s talent in the area of software development. The problem lies in the lack of a practical and fast way to learn the programming skills demanded by technological companies in Guatemala, and the current solutions focused on this problem have lacked results. The way we help people get jobs in well known and regarded technological companies is by teaching them through a personalized method the skills demanded by these companies. Besides the technical subjects the students learn in Cognits, we complement these skills with the proper experiences for them to grow on their personal skills, and help them find the importance of this in the workplace and their life (self-learning, teamwork, leadership, integrity, communication, etc.)."

Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.

      "content": "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.[6] JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded."
